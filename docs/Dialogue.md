Basically the dialogue is handled the same way that base ddlc would handle it.

For instance:

s "Doc Dialouge 1"
m "Doc Dialouge 2"
n "Doc Dialouge 3"
y "Doc Dialouge 4"
mc "MC Moment"

s stands for Sayori
m stands for Monika
n stands for Natsuki
y stands for Yuri
mc stands for "" (The name you input at the beginning of the game, which isn't done yet at the time of writing this so it's gonna be defined in the DialogueManager script.)
